We think that the queue is growing exponentially when cells
have multiple parents and children in a chain.

This is because the fibonacci speed test (N = 1000) timed out.

After every iteration of our BFS, we removed duplicates from the queue.
Now the fibonacci test (N = 1000) takes 2.772 seconds, which is a drastic
improvement from the time out. This validates our change.

We think that we are updating too many descendent cells when we change the
value of a cell.

We think this because parsing takes 1.37 / 1.45 seconds of our
long chain test ( N = 1000) and 1.995/2.218 seconds of our wide chain test.

This change did not affect the total parsing time or speeds: 1.34/1.42 seconds
for long chain test, and 2.01/2.25 seconds for wide chain test. This is
probably due to the fact that all cell values are updated in those tests.
It is inconclusive whether this change improves speed at this point.
